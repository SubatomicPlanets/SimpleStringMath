# StrToMath
This is an example on how to evaluate a mathematical expression from a string.  
You can use this file as a python library if you want to.  
Currently only + - * / ^ are possible. I will add more in the future.  
If there are any issues, please let me know. I did not have a lot of time for testing.  
  
# examples:
"what's 53+7*6/2 ?"  ->  74  
"what is 9 * 67+90?" ->  693  
"2^7"                ->  128
